## Installation

To use the examples and practice the exercises provided in this course, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NAVTTC-Python-Programming.git
    cd NAVTTC-Python-Programming
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
